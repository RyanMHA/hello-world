Hot on the scene, ready to learn and build!
I love automations, but I'm constantly frustrated with the shortcomings of many automation options out there across the many programs in common tech stacks. So with my limited knowledge of coding I've been relying on other tools (Zapier for example) to help put the pieces together to accomplish my goal, but those are limited as well and often end up being sloppy bandaids. Well I'm tired of doing that, now I want to build them from the ground up so they can be clean and polished and function exactly as I need them to. Maybe even sell one or two some day. The vision is there, but I don't know how to use my tools yet (meaning I currently don't know how to write much of anything in any code languages), so I've got a lot to learn first.
